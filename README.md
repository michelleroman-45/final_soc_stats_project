# Final Social Statistics Project
This repository is a library for analyzing data from the General Social Survey data set. 

The questions in this exploratory analysis were to fulfill the requirements for the Social Statistics course SOAN 0385 @ Middlebury College in the Spring 2017. 

## Course Description

"In this course we will learn the practical tools social sociologists and other scientists use to analyze data quantitatively. Topics will emphasize applications with statistical software and data from the General Social Survey and other datasets. We will explore methods to describe statistics about samples, apply the principles of probability to make predictions about populations, and estimate the significance of those predictions through inference and hypothesis testing. We will conclude with an introduction to linear regression." 

## Analytical Question and Null Hypothesis 

What is the relationship between self-reported health, class and the continuous variable “helpsick” which asks whether the government should help pay for medical care? 

I propose that the health of the respondent would necessarily effect how high their medical bills are and consequently they might be more likely to support more government medical assistance. As such they should be negatively correlated, as the quality of the health of the respondent increases the belief in government assistance from medical care should decrease. The control variable class relates this association in that the extremes of the income brackets could have set views on how the government should be assisting citizens with medical bills despite their own health. 

A working-class respondent then, could be in excellent health and believe that the government should assist with medical care, while an upper-class respondent with poor health and high medical bills wouldn’t necessarily think the government should help possibly because they have the resources to take care it themselves. 

# About the Data

I’ll be using the full set of observations from 1972-2016 and I’ve excluded all missing values from each variable in my analysis. The audience for this report is all professionals involved in public health policy.

## Installation

TODO _ ADD INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

## Usage

TODO_ Add instructions for pulling and running the code and make the code abstract enough to run independently

```r
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
